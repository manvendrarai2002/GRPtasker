[cite\_start]The initial login page is a welcoming landing page that highlights the core features of GRP Tasker, including task management, team collaboration, and analytics[cite: 1]. [cite\_start]It provides a clear entry point for users with a prominent login button[cite: 1].

-----

### Login and Admin Dashboard

[cite\_start]Clicking the **Login** button takes you to a simple login page where you can enter your credentials[cite: 2]. [cite\_start]After logging in as an admin, you're directed to the **Admin Dashboard**, which serves as the central control panel for creating new tasks, groups, and users, as well as managing user roles[cite: 4].

### Employee Dashboard and Task View

[cite\_start]When an employee logs in, their dashboard displays all their assigned tasks, showing their progress and due dates[cite: 4]. [cite\_start]Clicking on a task, such as "task1," opens a detailed view where they can see the checklist items and add comments for updates[cite: 3].

-----

### Task Completion and Notifications

[cite\_start]Once a task is complete, an employee can update the checklist and leave a comment for the admin[cite: 5, 6]. [cite\_start]For example, the image shows a comment from "Jane Doe" stating "done and report has been mailed to you"[cite: 5]. [cite\_start]This action triggers a notification for the admin, who can then review the update[cite: 5, 6].
